## Sushi Redesign <> Privi| Codingsh | OitoWork | 




## Core Requirements:

Polygon version
Connect web3 wallet (Metamask)
Show user MATIC balance and connected wallet address
- Swap feature (at default settings)
- Standard token list as on Sushiswap (Polygon)
- Widget to add custom token feature by name or contract address as pair
- Display ...
- balance of origin (A) and target (B) on connected wallet
- Corresponding amount of target (B) token for swap
- Exchange rate 1 (B) = xx (A)
- Corresponding $ value for outcome
Include max. function for origin (A) token
Switch view between token A->B to B->A
Add/remove liquidity:
- Standard token lists
- Widget to add custom token by name or contract address
- Show active Sushiswap LP pairs and balance
Include farm tool
- Display Pair, TVL, Rewards rate and APR
- Add staking and unstaking functionality including current balances and max function
Bonus requirements:
- Add Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum chain support and relevant token lists
- Allow extra swap transaction settings (custom slippage tolerance, execution time)
- Display top pools list
- Connect other web3 wallets

### General requirements:
- Use a provided Privi UI for frontend and visual elements
- You cannot use any copyrighted elements of the provider design (Uniswapâ€¦) including name and mark. You should also make sure the visual elements are distinct and that users cannot confuse this frontend with the official interface.

### Considerations:
- All web3 actions should be done through local providers such as MetaMask.
- Hosting is going to take place an Arweave in collaboration with the team 


### Documentation:

**Code should be well documented inline, and any deployment/setup steps should have separate documentation.**

- Any variables (contracts, tokens, endpoints, etc) should be well labelled and pulled in from a specific variables file so that they can be easily referenced if they ever need to be documented.
